### Challenge

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to write a Ruby program that meets the following requirements:

+ The program accepts as arguments a list of one or more file paths (e.g. `./solution.rb file1.txt file2.txt ...`).
+ The program also accepts input on stdin (e.g. `cat file1.txt | ./solution.rb`).
+ The program outputs a list of the 100 most common three word sequences in the text, along with a count of how many times each occurred in the text. For example:
    + 231 - i will not
    + 116 - i do not
    + 105 - there is no
    + 54 - i know not
    + 37 - i am not
    ...
+ The program ignores punctuation, line endings, and is case insensitive (e.g. "I love\nsandwiches." should be treated the same as "(I LOVE SANDWICHES!!)")
+ The program is capable of processing large files and runs as fast as possible.
+ You should push to GitHub at least three times.
+ Provide a test file for your solution

So, set your own pace. No rush. And just so you have some bounds the challenge was designed to take somewhere between 2 and 3 hours.
